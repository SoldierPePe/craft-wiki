PhotoCraft's menus are **File**, **Edit**, **Image**, **Layer**, **Type**, **Select**, **Filter**, **View**, **Window** and **Help**. If you can't find a command, choose **Edit › Search…** (**Ctrl+F**, or **⌘F** on a Mac) and type its name.

In this guide, **Ctrl** is **⌘** on a Mac, and **Alt** is **Option**.

## Adjust colors without changing your pixels

An adjustment layer sits above your image and changes how it looks. Your original pixels stay as they were, so you can change or remove the adjustment at any time.

1. In the **Layers** panel, click the layer the adjustment should sit above.
2. Choose **Layer › New Adjustment Layer**, then an adjustment such as **Levels…**, **Curves…**, **Vibrance…** or **Hue/Saturation…**.
3. Change its settings in the **Properties** panel.

The same list is behind the **Create new fill or adjustment layer** button at the bottom of the **Layers** panel.

The adjustments are **Brightness/Contrast**, **Levels**, **Curves**, **Exposure**, **Vibrance**, **Hue/Saturation**, **Color Balance**, **Black & White**, **Photo Filter**, **Channel Mixer**, **Color Lookup**, **Invert**, **Posterize**, **Threshold**, **Gradient Map** and **Selective Color**.

![Monet's Impression, Sunrise with Levels 1 and Vibrance 1 adjustment layers. The Properties panel shows the Levels settings over a histogram, and the Histogram panel below lists the mean, standard deviation and median](/assets/uploads/photocraft/adjustments.webp)

If you don't need to change it later, use **Image › Adjustments** instead, for example **Image › Adjustments › Curves…** (**Ctrl+M**). This changes the layer's pixels directly.

## Select part of an image

Use one of these:

- **Rectangular Marquee Tool** or **Elliptical Marquee Tool** (**M**) for simple shapes.
- **Lasso Tool** (**L**) to draw around something by hand.
- **Quick Selection Tool**, **Object Selection Tool** or **Magic Wand Tool** (**W**) to follow the edges of an object.
- **Select › Subject** to let PhotoCraft find the main subject. If it finds nothing, try the **Object Selection Tool** or the **Lasso Tool**.

Smart selection runs on your computer. It needs no account and no internet connection.

Then refine the selection:

- **Select › Inverse** (**Ctrl+Shift+I**) swaps what is and isn't selected.
- **Select › Modify** has **Border…**, **Smooth…**, **Expand…**, **Contract…** and **Feather…**. Feather softens the edge.
- **Select › Select and Mask…** refines a difficult edge, such as hair.
- **Select › Deselect** (**Ctrl+D**) removes the selection. **Select › Reselect** brings it back.

## Mask a layer

A mask hides part of a layer without erasing it.

1. Make a selection.
2. Click the layer in the **Layers** panel.
3. Choose **Layer › Layer Mask › Reveal Selection** to show only the selected area, or **Hide Selection** to hide it.

This works on adjustment layers too, so you can limit an adjustment to one area.

![Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring with an elliptical selection around her face. A Hue/Saturation 1 layer with Saturation at -100 has a mask that leaves the face in color and turns the rest of the painting gray](/assets/uploads/photocraft/masks.webp)

**Layer › Layer Mask** also has **Reveal All** and **Hide All** (to paint the mask yourself), **Delete**, **Apply**, and **Disable Layer Mask** (**Enable Layer Mask** while it is off) to switch the mask on and off.

## Add and edit text

1. Pick the **Horizontal Type Tool** (**T**).
2. Click on the canvas for a single line of text, or drag a box for a paragraph.
3. Type. Set the font, size, leading, tracking, alignment and color in the options bar or the **Properties** panel.

![A landscape with the headline SIERRA NEVADA being edited on the canvas, a byline below it and a paragraph of body text. The Properties panel shows the Character and Paragraph settings for the Georgia font](/assets/uploads/photocraft/type.webp)

Text stays editable: click it with the Type tool to change it. Text layers from PSD files stay editable too. To start new text on top of an existing text layer, hold **Shift** as you click.

The **Type** menu has **Convert to Paragraph Text** and **Convert to Point Text**, **Warp Text…**, **Convert to Shape** (turn the letters into vector shapes) and **Rasterize Type Layer** (turn them into pixels; you can't edit the words after that).

## Add a layer style

1. Click the layer in the **Layers** panel.
2. Choose **Layer › Layer Style**, then an effect: **Bevel & Emboss…**, **Stroke…**, **Inner Shadow…**, **Inner Glow…**, **Satin…**, **Color Overlay…**, **Gradient Overlay…**, **Pattern Overlay…**, **Outer Glow…** or **Drop Shadow…**.
3. Adjust it in the **Layer Style** dialog and click **OK**. Select more effects in the list on the left to combine them.

![The Layer Style dialog over a poster with the word EARTHRISE in glowing letters. Stroke and Outer Glow are checked, and the Outer Glow settings show the blend mode, opacity, color, spread, size and range](/assets/uploads/photocraft/layer-styles.webp)

Effects are listed under the layer in the **Layers** panel. **Layer › Layer Style** also has **Copy Layer Style**, **Paste Layer Style**, **Clear Layer Style** and **Hide All Effects**.

## Use filters

The **Filter** menu has blurs, sharpening, noise, distortions such as **Twirl** and **Wave**, pixelate, stylize and render filters. Filter dialogs preview on the canvas as you change them. If there is a selection, the filter only changes the selected area.

![The Twirl filter dialog with Angle set to 320 and Preview checked. On Van Gogh's The Starry Night, the twirl shows live only inside a circular selection](/assets/uploads/photocraft/filters.webp)

To keep a filter editable, run it on a smart object. You can then change, hide or remove it later.

## Transform

**Edit › Free Transform** (**Ctrl+T**) scales, rotates and moves the active layer. **Edit › Transform** has **Scale**, **Rotate**, **Skew**, **Distort**, **Perspective** and **Warp**, exact rotations, and **Flip Horizontal** and **Flip Vertical**. **Edit › Transform › Again** repeats the last transform.

To change the size of the whole image, use **Image › Image Size…**. To add space around it without scaling, use **Image › Canvas Size…**.

## Export an image

**File › Export › Export As…** makes a flat copy of your image for sharing. Your layered document isn't changed.

1. Under **File Settings**, pick a **Format**: **PNG**, **JPG**, **WebP**, **TIFF**, **TGA**, **ICO** or **JPEG XL**.
2. Set the options for that format. **JPG** and lossy **WebP** have a **Quality** slider. **WebP** has a **Lossless** checkbox. **Transparency** keeps transparent areas (JPG has none). **Metadata** is **None**, **EXIF** or **All**.
3. Under **Image Size**, set **Scale** in percent. The size in pixels shows below.
4. Check the preview and the estimated file size, then click **Export**.

![The Export As dialog in the light theme over Klimt's The Kiss. Format is JPG at Quality 90 and Scale 50%, giving 1199 × 1200 px, and the preview reads JPG ≈ 684K](/assets/uploads/photocraft/export.webp)

**File › Export › Quick Export as PNG** exports right away, using the settings in **File › Export › Export Preferences…**.

To export one layer, use **Layer › Export As…** or **Layer › Quick Export as PNG**. With several layers or artboards selected, each one is exported as its own file.

## Print

1. Choose **File › Print…** (**Ctrl+P**).
2. Pick a printer under **Printer** and set **Copies**.
3. Choose the **Paper** and **Orientation**, then position and size the image. **Scale to Fit Media** fills the page.
4. Under **Color Management**, choose who handles color: **Printer Manages Colors**, **PhotoCraft Manages Colors** or **No Color Management**. If you choose **PhotoCraft Manages Colors** on Windows, turn off the printer's own color management in **Print Settings…**.
5. Check the preview, then click **Print**.

When the job is sent, the status bar says **Sent to** and the printer's name. **File › Print One Copy** (**Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P**) prints one copy with the settings of your last print. If you haven't printed yet, it opens the dialog.

You can also drag the image on the preview to move it. **Printing Marks** adds crop and registration marks. To make a PDF instead of printing, use the **Save as PDF** box at the bottom of the dialog.

On Linux, PhotoCraft prints through CUPS. If it can't find a printer there, it opens your system's print dialog instead. The Flatpak uses your computer's CUPS service.

## Colors, modes and profiles

**Image › Mode** changes how the image stores color: **Grayscale**, **RGB Color**, **CMYK Color**, **Lab Color**, **Indexed Color**, **Duotone**, **Bitmap** or **Multichannel**. Below those, **8 Bits/Channel**, **16 Bits/Channel** and **32 Bits/Channel** set the depth. Converting to a smaller mode, such as CMYK or Indexed Color, can change colors. Keep a copy of your RGB original.

Color profiles tell PhotoCraft what the numbers in a file mean:

- **Edit › Color Settings…** (**Ctrl+Shift+K**) sets your working color spaces and what PhotoCraft does when a file's profile differs from them.
- **Edit › Assign Profile…** labels the document with a different profile without changing its pixels. Only profiles that fit the document's mode are offered.
- **Edit › Convert to Profile…** changes the pixels so the picture looks the same in the new profile.

To preview how the image will look in another color space, choose **View › Proof Setup**, pick a profile, then turn on **View › Proof Colors** (**Ctrl+Y**). **View › Gamut Warning** (**Ctrl+Shift+Y**) marks colors the proof profile can't reproduce. **Edit › Preferences › Transparency & Gamut…** sets how the warning looks.

## Open camera raw files

When you open a camera raw file with **File › Open…**, a **RAW Develop** window opens first. Adjust the photo there and click **Open**, or click **Cancel** to close the file again. To change this, open **Edit › Preferences › RAW Defaults…**.

You can also run the same controls on any layer with **Filter › RAW Develop Filter…** (**Ctrl+Shift+A**).

## Record and replay actions

The **Actions** panel (**Window › Actions**, or **Alt+F9**) records a sequence of steps and plays it back. Its menu loads and saves action sets in Photoshop's `.atn` format.

### Batch processing

1. Record the steps you want as an action.
2. Select the action in the **Actions** panel, then choose **File › Automate › Batch…**.
3. Choose the source folder, or the documents you have open. Turn on **Include All Subfolders** if you want the images inside folders too.
4. Set where the results go. In **File Naming**, use tokens such as `{name}` and `{serial}` to name them. Leave it empty to keep the original names.
5. Run it. **Stop on error** ends the batch at the first file that fails. **Error log** writes a text file of the files that failed.

For example, `{name}_{serial}{ext}` writes `photo_001.png`, `photo_002.png` and so on. Add `{ext}` yourself: a template without it writes names with no extension.

Other tools in the same area:

- **File › Automate › Create Droplet…** saves the selected action as a droplet file. Record an action first. To run a droplet from a script, see [Automation and AI agents](/apps/photocraft/automation/).
- **File › Scripts › Image Processor…** converts a folder of images to JPEG, PNG, PSD or TIFF, and can resize them, without recording an action.
- **File › Automate › Fit Image…** fits the image inside a width and height you set.
- **File › Automate › Contact Sheet II…** places a folder of images as thumbnails on one sheet.
- **File › Export › Layers to Files…** and **File › Export › Artboards to Files…** save each layer or artboard as its own file.

A recorded **Image Size** step doesn't resize batches correctly yet. See [Known problems, not fixed yet](/apps/photocraft/troubleshooting/#known-problems-not-fixed-yet).

Blur, Sharpen and Smudge, the Single Row and Single Column Marquee tools, and the Add Anchor Point, Delete Anchor Point and Convert Point tools have no key. Pick them from the toolbox. **Filter › Liquify…** (**Ctrl+Shift+X**) pushes pixels around.

## Plug-ins

PhotoCraft doesn't run Photoshop plug-ins, and it has no **Extensions** menu. It runs filters written as WebAssembly (`.wasm`) files, which work the same on every system. Installed plug-ins appear in **Filter › Plug-ins**; **Install Plug-in…** is in the same menu. To load a whole folder of them each time PhotoCraft starts, use **Edit › Preferences › Plugins…**.

## Where to find a setting

**Edit › Preferences** (on a Mac, **PhotoCraft › Settings**) has one page per area. Pages you may look for:

| Page | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| **General…** | General options, including update checks |
| **AI Integrations…** | **Allow agent control** |
| **Interface…** | Language, font size, scaling and the system title bar |
| **File Handling…** | Recovery saves and PSD options |
| **Performance…** | **Rendering Mode**, memory use and the Linux display server |
| **Scratch Disks…** | Where PhotoCraft puts the part of a big file that doesn't fit in memory |
| **RAW Defaults…** | How raw files open |
| **Plugins…** | The folder of extra plug-ins |

Others are **Workspace…**, **Tools…**, **History Log…**, **Export…**, **Cursors…**, **Transparency & Gamut…**, **Units & Rulers…**, **Guides, Grid & Slices…** and **Type…**.

## Change how PhotoCraft looks

- **Window › Theme** has dark and light themes, and **Sync with system** to follow your computer's setting.
- **Window › Workspace** switches between panel layouts: **Essentials**, **Photography**, **Painting**, **Pixel Art**, **Graphic and Web** and **Motion**. **Reset Workspace** puts the panels back.
- **Tab** hides and shows all panels. **Shift+Tab** hides and shows only the panels on the right.

To change the interface language, open **Edit › Preferences › Interface…** (on a Mac, also **PhotoCraft › Language**). By default, PhotoCraft follows your system's language.
