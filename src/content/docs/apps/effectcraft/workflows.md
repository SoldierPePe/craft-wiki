On a Mac, use **⌘** in place of **Ctrl**, and **Option** in place of **Alt**.

## Panels and workspaces

EffectCraft's panels follow After Effects: **Project**, **Composition**, **Timeline**, **Effect Controls**, **Effects & Presets**, **Properties**, **Preview**, **Character**, **Paragraph**, **Align**, **Info**, **Audio** and the **Render Queue**, among others. Open any of them from the **Window** menu.

The workspace buttons at the top right (**Default**, **Review**, **Standard**, **Small Screen** and more) rearrange the panels for different jobs.

## Import footage

Choose **File › Import › File...** (**Ctrl+I**) to pick a file, or **File › Import › Multiple Files...** for several. You can also drop files or folders on the window. Files dropped on the Composition panel become layers there.

Photoshop, PDF and Illustrator files ask whether to import them as footage or as a composition. **Window › Media Browser** browses your folders and imports what you pick.

### Image sequences

Numbered stills, such as `shot_0001.png`, `shot_0002.png` and so on, can import as one clip:

1. Choose **File › Import › File...** and pick any one file of the run.
2. In the **Import Image Sequence** window, select the sequence option. It's named after the file type, for example **PNG Sequence**, and it's off by default.
3. Set **Frame rate (fps)**, then confirm.

If a frame is missing, EffectCraft shows color bars for it. Add the missing file and choose **File › Reload Footage** (**Ctrl+Alt+L**).

### Change how footage is read

Select the footage in the Project panel and choose **File › Interpret Footage › Main...** (**Ctrl+Alt+G**) to change its alpha, frame rate or start timecode. **File › Replace Footage › File...** (**Ctrl+H**) points the item at another file.

## Animate

- Click the stopwatch beside a property to start animating it. Change the value at another time and a new keyframe appears.
- **F9** applies **Easy Ease** to the selected keyframes. **Shift+F9** eases in and **Ctrl+Shift+F9** eases out. They are under **Animation › Keyframe Assistant**.
- **Animation › Toggle Hold Keyframe** makes a keyframe jump instead of moving smoothly.
- **Animation › Keyframe Interpolation...** and **Keyframe Velocity...** set the curve exactly.
- The **Graph Editor** shows value and speed graphs with handles you can drag. Turn it on with the **Graph Editor** button at the top of the Timeline.
- **Alt**+click a stopwatch to add an expression. Expressions are JavaScript, with familiar functions such as `wiggle` and `loopOut`.

### Show one property in the Timeline

Select layers and press a key to show only that property:

| Key | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| **P** | Position |
| **S** | Scale |
| **R** | Rotation |
| **T** | Opacity |
| **A** | Anchor Point |
| **E** | Effects |
| **M** | Masks |
| **F** | Mask Feather |
| **L** | Audio Levels (press twice for the waveform) |

## Add effects

Select a layer, then choose an effect from the **Effect** menu, where effects are grouped by category. Or open **Window › Effects & Presets** (**Ctrl+5**), search, and double-click the effect or drag it onto a layer.

Change its settings in **Effect Controls** (**F3**).

- **Effect › Last Effect** applies the effect you used last.
- **Effect › Remove All** removes every effect from the selected layers.
- In **Effects & Presets**, click the star beside an effect to add it to your favorites. Recently used effects are listed too.

For drop shadows, glows and bevels, use **Layer › Layer Styles**. It has **Drop Shadow**, **Inner Shadow**, **Outer Glow**, **Inner Glow**, **Bevel and Emboss** and **Satin**, among others.

## Render

1. Select a composition and choose **Composition › Add to Render Queue** (**Ctrl+M**). You can also drag compositions onto the **Render Queue** panel (**Window › Render Queue**, **Ctrl+Alt+0**).
2. Twirl the item open. Click **Output Module** to choose the format, and the file name next to **Output To** to choose where it goes.
3. Click **Render Settings** to render the work area only or the whole composition, at best or draft quality, or at full, half, third or quarter resolution.
4. Make sure the item's **Render** box is checked, then choose **Render**. **Stop** cancels.

Select **Notify** to get a notification when the queue finishes.

### Formats

| Output Module format | File |
| --- | --- |
| H.264 | `.mp4` |
| HEVC (H.265) | `.mp4` |
| AV1 | `.mp4` |
| QuickTime (ProRes) | `.mov` |
| QuickTime (Uncompressed) | `.mov` |
| WebM (VP9 + Opus) | `.webm` |
| PNG, JPEG, TIFF, Targa or OpenEXR Sequence | One image per frame |
| Animated GIF | `.gif` |
| WAV, AIFF | Audio only |

To keep transparency, choose **Channels: RGB + Alpha** in the **Output Module** menu. It's there for formats that can store it, such as ProRes and PNG Sequence. H.264, HEVC and AV1 can't.

EffectCraft encodes everything itself. You don't need FFmpeg or any other software.

## Lottie

Choose **File › Export › Lottie JSON...** to save a composition as a Lottie animation (`.json` or `.lottie`) for websites and apps. EffectCraft lists anything Lottie can't express. **File › Import › Lottie...** opens a Lottie file as a new composition.

## Plug-ins

EffectCraft can't run After Effects plug-ins, but it has its own:

- **Effect › Plug-in Library...** lets you search, install and update community effects.
- **Effect › Install Effect Plug-in...** installs a plug-in file you have downloaded.

## Tracking and Roto Brush

The tracking commands are on the **Animation** menu:

- **Track Motion** and **Stabilize Motion** follow a point in a clip, or steady a shaky one.
- **Warp Stabilizer VFX** smooths camera shake.
- **Track Camera** solves a 3D camera from a clip.
- **Track Mask** moves a mask with the footage.
- **Track this Property** drives a selected property from a track.

Open **Window › Tracker** for the tracker's controls.

Roto Brush and face tracking work out of the box and can also use optional trained models. They are open source and EffectCraft downloads them only when you ask. Open **Edit › Preferences**, choose the **Roto Brush** or **Face Tracking** page, and download a model from the list.

## Presets, templates and Essential Graphics

- **Animation › Save Animation Preset...** saves the animation on the selected layers. **Apply Animation Preset...** puts it on other layers, and **Browse Presets...** lists what you have. **Text Animation Presets** has ready-made text moves such as **Typewriter** and **Bounce In Words**.
- **File › Save as Template...** saves the open project as a template. **File › New › New Project from Template...** starts a project from one.
- **Animation › Add Property to Essential Graphics** exposes a property so it can be changed without opening the composition. **File › Export › Essential Graphics Template...** saves the result, and **File › Import › Essential Graphics Template...** opens one.

## Scripts

EffectCraft runs After Effects-style `.jsx` scripts.

- **File › Scripts › Run Script File...** runs a script once.
- **File › Scripts › Install Script File...** and **Install ScriptUI Panel...** add a script or a panel to EffectCraft. Installed scripts are listed in **File › Scripts**, and panels in the **Window** menu.
- **Window › Script Console** shows script output and errors, with the file and line.
- **Help › Scripting Help...** opens the reference.

Scripts can't write files or use the network until you check **Allow Scripts to Write Files and Access Network** on the **Scripting & Expressions** page of **Edit › Preferences**. To run a script without opening the app, use `effectcraft-cli script FILE.jsx`.

## Proxies

For heavy footage, use a small stand-in while you work. Select the footage in the Project panel, then:

- **File › Create Proxy › Movie...** or **Still...** renders a proxy file.
- **File › Set Proxy › File...** uses a file you already have. **None** goes back to the original.
- **File › Interpret Footage › Proxy...** changes how the proxy is read.

## Move a project to another computer

Footage stays where it is, so copying only the project file leaves it missing. Use **File › Dependencies** first:

- **Collect Files...** copies the project and its footage into one folder.
- **Consolidate All Footage** merges duplicate footage items into one.
- **Remove Unused Footage** deletes items that no composition uses.
- **Reduce Project** removes every item the selected compositions don't use.

**File › Save As › Save a Copy As XML...** saves a text copy of the project. **Increment and Save** saves a new numbered version, and **Revert** goes back to the last saved version.

## Composition and layer tools

- **Pre-compose**: select layers and choose **Layer › Pre-compose...**. Name the new composition under **New composition name**. **Move all attributes into the new composition** nests the selected layers as they are. **Leave all attributes in** (one footage, solid or composition layer only) nests only the layer's source and keeps its transform, masks and effects in the current composition. **Adjust composition duration to the time span of the selected layers** trims the new composition. **Layer › Un-precompose** reverses it.
- **Composition Mini-Flowchart**: **Composition › Composition Mini-Flowchart** (**Tab**) pops up the compositions nested in the current one. It says **No nested compositions** when there are none. **Composition › Composition Flowchart** opens the full flowchart.
- **Auto-trace**: **Layer › Auto-trace...** turns a layer's picture into masks. Pick the **Time Span** (**Current Frame** or **Work Area**) and the **Channel** to trace: **Alpha**, **Red**, **Green**, **Blue** or **Luminance**. **Threshold (%)** sets where the shape begins, and **Minimum Area (pixels)** drops tiny specks. Check **Apply To New Layer** to put the masks on a new solid.
- **Content-Aware Fill**: remove something from footage. Draw a mask around it, set the mask's mode to **Subtract**, select the layer, and open **Window › Content-Aware Fill**. Pick a **Fill Method** (**Object**, **Surface** or **Edge Blend**), a **Range** (**Work Area** or **Entire Duration**), and optionally **Alpha Expansion** and **Lighting Correction**. Click **Generate Fill Layer**. It runs in the background (watch **Window › Progress**) and adds a fill layer above the original.
- **Freeze Frame**: **Layer › Time › Freeze Frame** holds the frame at the current time for the whole layer. **Freeze On Last Frame** holds the last frame. Both need a footage or composition layer, and both turn on time remapping for it.
- **Convert Audio to Keyframes**: **Animation › Keyframe Assistant › Convert Audio to Keyframes** adds a null layer named **Audio Amplitude**. Its **Left Channel**, **Right Channel** and **Both Channels** sliders get a keyframe on every frame of the work area. Link other properties to them with expressions to make things move with the sound.
- **Convert Expression to Keyframes**: select a property that has an expression, then choose **Animation › Keyframe Assistant › Convert Expression to Keyframes**. EffectCraft writes the expression's result as keyframes and turns the expression off.

## Render faster

- In a Render Queue item's **Render Settings** menu, pick half or quarter resolution and draft quality for tests.
- **Composition › Preview › Cache Frames When Idle** renders frames while you aren't playing.
- **Edit › Purge** frees cache memory. **All Memory** is the quick one.
- The **Memory & CPU** and **Disk** pages of **Edit › Preferences** set how much memory and disk space EffectCraft may use.
- `effectcraft-cli` renders on the processor by default. Add `--gpu` to use the graphics card.

## Reuse render settings, and render from a folder

**Edit › Templates › Render Settings...** and **Output Module...** save settings you use often, so you can pick them in the Render Queue.

**File › Watch Folder...** renders queued projects for you. Put a project with queued Render Queue items in the folder, or use **Collect Files...** to write one there. When EffectCraft starts a project, it writes `<project>.status.json` next to it, and it won't render that project again until you delete the status file.

To save a still, choose **Composition › Save Frame As** (**File...**, **Photoshop Layers...** or **ProEXR...**) or **Copy Frame to Clipboard**.

From the command line, `effectcraft-cli render` also takes `--work-area`, `--resolution`, `--quality` and, for a whole queue, `render project.ecproj --queue`.

## Settings and shortcuts

Choose **Edit › Preferences** on Windows and Linux, or **EffectCraft › Settings...** on a Mac. The pages include **General**, **Startup & Repair**, **Project**, **Composition**, **Previews**, **Appearance**, **Import**, **Audio**, **Disk**, **Memory & CPU** and **Scripting & Expressions**. The interface language is on the **General** page, under **Language**.

**Help › Keyboard Shortcuts...** shows every shortcut.
