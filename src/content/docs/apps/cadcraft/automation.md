Everything in CADCraft is a command, so anything you can do by hand you can also script. Scripts and LISP routines run inside the app. The `cadcraft-cli` tool runs CADCraft without a window, and lets AI agents draw through MCP.

## Run a script

A script (`.scr`) is a text file with what you would type at the command line, one line at a time. Choose **Tools › Run Script...** to run one.

## Load LISP routines

CADCraft runs AutoLISP routines (`.lsp`). Choose **Tools › Load Application...**, or type `(load "name")` at the command line. Most routines that draw, edit and ask for points or objects work as they are.

To load routines every time, put them in the `support` folder inside CADCraft's settings folder, and load them from an `acad.lsp` or `acaddoc.lsp` file there:

| System | Support folder |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\CADCraft\support\` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/CADCraft/support/` |
| Linux | `~/.config/cadcraft/support/` |

A drawing's own folder is never searched, so an `acaddoc.lsp` that came with a downloaded drawing doesn't run.

### Which startup file to use

| File | When it loads |
| --- | --- |
| `acad.lsp` | Once per session, into the first drawing only. If you set the `ACADLSPASDOC` system variable to 1, into every drawing |
| `acaddoc.lsp` | Into every drawing you open or create, including a new drawing from **QNEW** |

If your routines vanish after you close the first drawing or start a new one, move the `(load ...)` line from `acad.lsp` to `acaddoc.lsp`. A routine defined in `acad.lsp` belongs to the first drawing and goes away with it.

After both files, CADCraft runs `S::STARTUP` if you defined it. To load a file the first time you type one of its commands, add `(autoload "file" '("CMD1" "CMD2"))` to a startup file.

:::note
Not supported yet: Visual LISP ActiveX functions (`vlax-…`, `vla-…`), DCL dialogs, reactors, compiled `.fas` and `.vlx` files, and C++ or .NET plug-ins.

## Change command aliases

Choose **Tools › Customize › Edit Command Aliases (PGP)...** to add, change or remove aliases. Your aliases are kept after a restart.

## Use cadcraft-cli

`cadcraft-cli` comes with the Windows, Linux and FreeBSD packages. On macOS it is a separate download: see [Install and update](/apps/cadcraft/install-update/#macos). Its main subcommands are:

| Subcommand | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `info` | Describes a drawing: its layers, blocks, objects and more, as JSON |
| `convert` | Converts a drawing, for example DWG to DXF, or DXF to SVG, PNG or PDF |
| `run` | Opens a drawing, runs commands or a script, and saves or exports the result |
| `commands` | Lists every command and its parameters |
| `mcp` | Starts an MCP server for AI agents |

For example:

```sh
cadcraft-cli info drawing.dxf
cadcraft-cli convert drawing.dwg drawing.pdf
cadcraft-cli run drawing.dxf --script-file setup.scr --save out.dxf
```

`cadcraft-cli --help` lists every option.

## Launch options and environment variables

`cadcraft --help` lists these too. You can give CADCraft files to open, and two options:

| Option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `<file> ...` | Opens these drawings |
| `--sample` | Opens the sample drawing |
| `--control <port>` | Starts the control port (see [Let an AI agent draw](#let-an-ai-agent-draw)) |

Set these environment variables before you start CADCraft. A blank value counts as not set, except for `CADCRAFT_CONFIG_DIR`.

| Variable | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `CADCRAFT_CONFIG_DIR` | The settings folder (logs, autosave, workspace, plotters). Set it to nothing to run with no settings folder |
| `CADCRAFT_LOCALE` | The interface language, instead of your system's |
| `CADCRAFT_VSYNC` | `1` presents with vsync, `0` without. The default is without on Linux and BSD |
| `CADCRAFT_WAYLAND` | `1` keeps the native Wayland backend instead of XWayland |
| `CADCRAFT_NO_NATIVE_MENU` | macOS: `1` keeps the menus inside the window |
| `CADCRAFT_SYSTEM_CURSOR` | `1` uses the system cursor instead of the drawn crosshair |
| `CADCRAFT_FONTALT` | The font that replaces a missing one. See [Fonts](/apps/cadcraft/files/#fonts) |
| `CADCRAFT_FONTFALLBACK` | The fonts tried, in order, for characters a font lacks |

## Let an AI agent draw

CADCraft has an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, so an AI assistant that supports MCP can draw and edit with it. The agent can type at the command line like a person, run any command, read back what is in the drawing to check its work, and look at a picture of it.

To give an agent its own drawing, with no window, add this to your MCP client's settings:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "cadcraft": { "command": "cadcraft-cli", "args": ["mcp"] } } }
```

To watch the agent work in the app instead:

1. Start CADCraft with a control port: `cadcraft --control 7979`.
2. Point your MCP client at it, with `"args": ["mcp", "--connect", "127.0.0.1:7979"]`.

The control port only listens on your own computer. The agent can then also take screenshots and click in the app.
