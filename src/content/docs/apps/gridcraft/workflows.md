GridCraft's ribbon groups its tools into tabs: **Home**, **Insert**, **Draw**, **Page Layout**, **Formulas**, **Data**, **Review**, **View** and **Automate**. More tabs, such as **Table Design** and **Chart Design**, appear when you select a table or a chart. If you can't find a command, click the search icon at the top right of the window, or choose **Automate › Command Palette**, and type its name.

## Write formulas

A formula starts with `=`. While you type one, click or drag across cells to add their references.

On the **Formulas** tab:

- **Insert Function** helps you find a function and fill in its arguments. The function library buttons next to it list functions by category.
- **AutoSum** adds a total of the cells next to the selection.
- **Name Manager** and **Define Name** give a cell or range a name you can use in formulas.
- **Trace Precedents** and **Trace Dependents** draw arrows to the cells a formula uses, or that use it. **Evaluate Formula** steps through a formula one part at a time.
- **Show Formulas** shows formulas in the cells instead of their results.
- **Calculation Options** switches between automatic and manual calculation. **Calculate Now** (**F9**) recalculates.

Dynamic-array formulas, such as `=SORT(A2:A20)` or `=UNIQUE(B2:B50)`, spill their results into the cells below and to the right.

### Regional formats

In every language but Spanish, you type formulas the English way: a comma between arguments and a period as the decimal point, as in `=ROUND(A1*0.29,2)`. A formula such as `=A1*0,29` shows an error.

GridCraft doesn't follow your system's number and date settings yet, and has no setting to pick a comma for decimals or a period for thousands. Numbers such as `12,34` are stored as text, and a format like `1.000,00` isn't available ([#3461](https://github.com/storytold/gridcraft/issues/3461), [#3447](https://github.com/storytold/gridcraft/issues/3447), [#3384](https://github.com/storytold/gridcraft/issues/3384), [#3148](https://github.com/storytold/gridcraft/issues/3148)).

:::note[Formulas in Spanish]
If you choose **Español** as the interface language, you type formulas in Spanish too: `=SUMA(A1:A3)`, with a decimal comma and semicolons between arguments. Workbooks are still saved with standard English formulas, so they open the same everywhere. Every other language uses English function names.

## Format cells

On the **Home** tab:

- Font, fill color, borders, alignment, **Wrap Text** and **Merge & Center**.
- Number formats, such as currency, percentage and dates. **Ctrl+1** opens **Format Cells** for every option.
- **Cell Styles** applies a ready-made look, such as a heading or a total.
- **Conditional Formatting** colors cells by their values: **Highlight Cells Rules**, **Top/Bottom Rules**, **Data Bars**, **Color Scales** and **Icon Sets**. **Manage Rules…** lists and edits them.
- **Format Painter** copies formatting from one place to another.

## Work with tables

Select your data and choose **Home › Format as Table**, **Insert › Table**, or press **Ctrl+T**. A table has banded rows and filter buttons on its header row. On the **Table Design** tab you can turn the **Total Row**, **Header Row** and **Banded Rows** on or off, and pick another style.

In a formula, you can refer to a table's columns by name, for example `=SUM(Sales[Q1])`.

## Sort, filter and clean up data

On the **Data** tab:

- **Sort** and **Filter**. **Ctrl+Shift+L** turns filter buttons on or off.
- **Text to Columns** splits one column into several. **Flash Fill** (**Ctrl+E**) fills a column by following an example you type.
- **Remove Duplicates** and **Data Validation**, which limits what can be typed in a cell, for example to a list.
- **Advanced** filters a list with a **Criteria range** you write on the sheet. You can filter in place, or choose **Copy to** another place, and select **Unique rows only**.
- **Group**, **Ungroup** and **Subtotal** to outline and summarize rows.
- **What-If Analysis**, **Forecast Sheet** and **Solver** for working out numbers.
- **Get Data (Text/CSV)** brings in data from a text file.

### Data Analysis

**Data › Data Analysis** has statistics tools that write a report into a new sheet, or to a cell you choose. Pick a tool, such as **Descriptive Statistics**, **Histogram**, **Regression**, **Correlation**, **Moving Average**, **Sampling**, **Random Number Generation** or a **t-Test**, then fill in its form. Select your data first and it's filled in as the **Input Range**. If the cells for the report already hold data, GridCraft asks before it replaces them. The report holds fixed values, so it doesn't change when your data does. Run the tool again to refresh it.

## Add charts and sparklines

Select your data, then on the **Insert** tab choose **Recommended Charts**, or one of the chart buttons next to it. **Sparklines** draws a tiny chart inside a cell.

When you select a chart, GridCraft outlines its source data on the sheet and opens the **Chart Design** tab. From there you can add chart elements, switch rows and columns, change the chart type, or open the **Format Pane** to change the title, legend, series and colors.

## Summarize with a pivot table

Click in a table or range, then choose **Insert › PivotTable**. In the **PivotTable Fields** pane, select the fields you want and move them between **Filters**, **Columns**, **Rows** and **Values**. Press **Refresh** after the source data changes. **Report Layout** changes how the table is laid out.

## Add pictures, shapes and comments

On the **Insert** tab:

- **Pictures** › **Place over Cells** floats a PNG or JPEG over the sheet. **Place in Cell** puts it inside the active cell, where it stays with the cell when you sort, filter or resize rows and columns.
- **Shapes**, **Icons**, **Text Box** and **Symbol**.
- **Link** adds a hyperlink (**Ctrl+K**).
- **Comment** starts a comment thread on a cell.

On the **Review** tab you can add notes, go through comments, check spelling (**F7**), run the accessibility checker, and protect a sheet or the workbook's structure with an optional password. **Allow Edit Ranges** lists ranges that stay editable when a sheet is protected, each with its own optional password. **Workbook Statistics** shows figures about the workbook.

### Draw with ink

The **Draw** tab is for freehand marks on a sheet. Choose **Pen Blue**, **Pen Black**, **Pen Red** or **Highlighter**, and draw. **Eraser** removes ink strokes. **Select Objects** selects and moves ink and shapes. **Ink to Shape** turns your last stroke into a shape.

### Slicers, checkboxes and equations

On the **Insert** tab:

- **Slicer** adds buttons that filter a table.
- **Checkbox** puts a checkbox in each selected cell.
- **Button**, **Slider** and **Spin Button** draw a form control on the sheet. A slider and a spin button set a whole number in a cell you link. A new button asks what it should run: a macro or a command.
- **Equation** opens an equation editor, and its arrow lists ready-made equations.
- **Header & Footer** switches to the page layout view, where you type the header and footer in place.

## Print and export

On the **Page Layout** tab, set **Margins**, orientation, paper **Size**, the **Print Area**, page **Breaks** and **Print Titles** (rows or columns that repeat on every page).

**View › Page Break Preview** shows where each page starts and ends.

![The Household Budget in Page Break Preview: the print area is outlined in blue, a dashed line splits it into Page 1 and Page 2, and the area outside it is grayed out](/assets/uploads/gridcraft/page-break.webp)

### Print

1. Choose **File › Print** (**Ctrl+P**).
2. Pick your printer under **Printer**. If you've only now plugged it in, choose **Refresh printers**.
3. Set **Copies**, **Two-sided printing** and **Grayscale** if you need them.
4. Choose **Print Active Sheets** or **Print Entire Workbook**.
5. To squeeze each sheet onto one page, select **Fit Sheet on One Page**.
6. Check the preview, then choose **Print**.

**Print** stays dimmed until a printer is selected. The preview is simplified, so small details such as borders can look a little different on paper.

**Page Setup…** on the print screen sets the margins and the **Page order**. Orientation, paper **Size**, **Print Area** and printed **Gridlines** and **Headings** are on the **Page Layout** tab, and header and footer text is in **Insert › Header & Footer**.

You can't print a page range or only the selection yet. See [Printing doesn't work as I expect](/apps/gridcraft/troubleshooting/#printing-doesnt-work-as-i-expect).

### Export

**File › Export › Create PDF** saves the active sheet as a PDF with its page layout. **File › Export** also saves the active sheet as CSV, or the workbook as a web page. These are copies: your workbook stays an .xlsx file.

## Record and run macros

A macro records a sequence of steps and plays them back, so you can repeat a task in one go. On the **Automate** tab:

1. Select the cells to work on, then choose **Record Macro**. Give the macro a name and, if you like, a **Ctrl+Shift** shortcut letter.
2. Do the steps you want to repeat.
3. Choose **Stop Recording**.

With **Use Relative References** on (the default), the macro works on whatever cells you select when you run it, not only the cells you recorded it on.

**Run Macro** runs the last macro you used, and its menu lists them all. **Macros** opens a list where you can run, edit, step through or delete each one. **New Macro** lets you write one step by step.

A macro runs as a single step, so one **Ctrl+Z** undoes all of it. If a step fails, GridCraft puts the workbook back as it was. Before a macro writes over cells that already hold data, it asks whether to overwrite them or shift them down or right.

To run a macro from the sheet, draw a **Button** on the **Insert** tab and choose the macro when it asks what to run.

:::caution
A macro is a list of GridCraft steps, not VBA. A workbook from Excel keeps its VBA macros when you save it as .xlsm, but GridCraft doesn't run them. Macros that came with a workbook you opened ask before they run.

## Change how GridCraft looks

On the **View** tab:

- **Normal**, **Page Break Preview** and **Page Layout** views.
- Show or hide the **Formula Bar**, **Gridlines** and **Headings**.
- **Zoom**, **100%** and **Zoom to Selection**.
- **Freeze Panes** keeps header rows or columns in view as you scroll.
- **New Window** and **Arrange All** to see two parts of a workbook at once.
- **Display theme**: **System**, **Light** or **Dark**.
- **Interface size** makes the whole window bigger or smaller.
- **Interface language**. By default, GridCraft follows your system's language.

More settings are in **File › Options**. See [The File view](#the-file-view).

## The File view

**File** opens a full-screen view with these pages:

| Page | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Home**, **New**, **Open** | Start a workbook, or open one from your recent list |
| **Info** | Shows the title, path and number of sheets, and lets you edit **Title**, **Subject**, **Author**, **Company**, **Keywords** and **Description**. **Protect Workbook** is here too |
| **Save As** | Saves as **Excel Workbook (\*.xlsx)**, **CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (\*.csv)**, **Web Page (\*.html)** or **PDF (\*.pdf)** |
| **Print**, **Export** | See [Print and export](#print-and-export) |
| **Options** | Settings, listed below |
| **Account** | Version and platform, and **About GridCraft** |

**Options** has:

- **Show formula bar**, and **Highlight the active cell's row**.
- **Enable AutoComplete for cell values**.
- **Save .xlsx workbooks automatically after every change** (AutoSave).
- For this workbook only: **Show horizontal scroll bar**, **Show vertical scroll bar** and **Show sheet tabs**.
- **Display theme** and **Interface language**.
- **Workbook calculation**: **Automatic**, **Automatic Except for Data Tables** or **Manual**. **Enable iterative calculation** lets a formula refer to itself, with a **Maximum Iterations** and **Maximum Change** you set. The calculation settings are saved with the workbook.

## Keyboard shortcuts

GridCraft uses the shortcuts you'd expect from a spreadsheet app. On a Mac, use **⌘** in place of **Ctrl** for most of them.

| Shortcut | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Ctrl+N**, **Ctrl+O**, **Ctrl+S** | New, open, save |
| **Ctrl+Shift+S** or **F12** | Save As |
| **Ctrl+B**, **Ctrl+I**, **Ctrl+U** | Bold, italic, underline |
| **Ctrl+Z** | Undo |
| **Ctrl+Y** or **Ctrl+Shift+Z** | Redo |
| **Ctrl+C**, **Ctrl+X**, **Ctrl+V** | Copy, cut, paste |
| **Ctrl+F**, **Ctrl+H** | Find, replace |
| **Ctrl+G** or **F5** | Go To |
| **Ctrl+1** | Format Cells |
| **Ctrl+T** | Make a table |
| **Ctrl+Shift+L** | Turn filters on or off |
| **Ctrl+D**, **Ctrl+R** | Fill down, fill right |
| **Ctrl+E** | Flash Fill |
| **Ctrl+;** | Enter today's date |
| **Ctrl+`** | Show formulas |
| **F2** | Edit the active cell |
| **F9** | Recalculate |
| **Shift+F11** | Insert a sheet |
| **Ctrl+Page Down**, **Ctrl+Page Up** | Next sheet, previous sheet |

To use the ribbon from the keyboard, press and release **Alt** (or press **F10**, which also works on a Mac), then type the letters that appear.
