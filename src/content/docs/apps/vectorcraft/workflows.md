In VectorCraft, every shape, line and letter is a path: an outline that stays sharp at any size. The guides below start with a new document and end with automation, and you can read each one on its own.

Shortcuts are written for Windows and Linux first, then macOS: **Ctrl+G** (**Cmd+G** on macOS). You can change every shortcut in **Edit → Keyboard Shortcuts…** (**Ctrl+Alt+Shift+K**, or **Cmd+Option+Shift+K** on macOS). **Help → Search Commands…** (**Ctrl+Shift+/**, or **Cmd+Shift+/** on macOS) finds any menu command by name.

:::note
Some menu items are grayed out. Those features are not built yet; they are listed so you can see what is coming.

## Draw in perspective

Show the grid with **View → Perspective Grid → Show Grid** (**Ctrl+Shift+I**, or **Cmd+Shift+I** on macOS). Choose **One Point Perspective**, **Two Point Perspective** or **Three Point Perspective** from the same menu. While the grid is showing, the Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon, Star and Line tools draw on its active plane. Use the **Perspective Selection Tool** (**Shift+V**) to move art along its plane.

[Draw in perspective](/apps/vectorcraft/draw-in-perspective/) covers adjusting the grid, choosing the active plane, putting flat art and type on a plane, and saving grid presets.

## Measure and dimension

The **Dimension Tool** adds lengths, angles and radii to technical drawings. Choose **Linear**, **Angular** or **Radial** in its bar, then drag out from an edge or click two points. The dimension follows the art when you change it. Set the units, precision and style in the **Properties** panel.

## Change how VectorCraft looks

- Choose **Edit → Preferences…** (**Ctrl+K**) and open the **User Interface** page. On macOS, choose **VectorCraft → Settings → User Interface…**. The page sets the **Brightness** (**Dark**, **Medium Dark**, **Medium Light** or **Light**), the **Accent Color**, the **Canvas Color** and the interface size under **UI Scaling**.
- **Language** on the same page changes the interface language. By default, VectorCraft follows your system's language.
- **Window → Workspace** switches between panel layouts and saves your own.
